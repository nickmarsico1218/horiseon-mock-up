# Horiseon Mock-up

## Description
The Horiseon initial web application did not meet current accessibility standards, by adding alt attributes to the images the application gives information if for some reason the image may not be viewed. Using semantic HTML elements the document follows a logical structure so that it can be read in a more concise manner.
Much of the CSS was redundant; it has been restructured so as nothing was unnecessarily repeated. Making these changes has helped me to understand the proper way to structure an HTML & CSS document to adhere to current industry standards, and how using semantic elements and the rule "Do Not Repeat Yourself" makes the documents easier to be read by others viewing/working with the code.
